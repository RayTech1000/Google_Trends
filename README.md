# Google_Trends
An analysis of Google Trends data using Python and Pytrends. 
Key data science features includes TrendReq from Pytrends, visuals, barcharts, and graphs.
While not too difficult, the resetting of the indicies and dataframes is very sensitive. Pytrends has it's own framework for how it organizes the data.
